# ESG Reporting frameworks and Envizi

ESG frameworks are used by organizations for the purpose of publicly reporting detailed environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics of the business

## 1. What are ESG frameworks?
ESG reporting frameworks are used by companies for the disclosure of data covering business operations and opportunities and risks related to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of the business.
ESG reporting frameworks are created by various organizations, including NGOs, stock exchanges, business groups, nonprofit organizations, think tanks and governments.
Although hundreds of ESG frameworks exist, only a dozen or so are considered major.
Each framework typically sets the metrics and qualitative elements that a company should disclose, as well as the format and reporting frequency. Some frameworks are voluntary, while others are government mandated.

## 2. Why ESG reporting matters
In response to rising `investor and community interest`, organizations are targeting sustainability performance improvements, setting ESG goals and reporting on their performance.

`Failure` to take ESG risks seriously could result in many `negative impacts for firms`, —from shareholder action at annual general meetings to divestment by asset managers.

The growing importance of ESG means that organizations are reporting their ESG impact using an ever-increasing range of different frameworks.

## 3. Selecting ESG reporting frameworks

Large number and variety of ESG reporting frameworks are available. Applying different lenses to assess and categorize the various frameworks can help selecting the appropriate ESG reporting frameworks for your organization.

### 3.1 Lens 1: Potential for impact

The decision on which framework to report to use should start by considering where an
organization can make the most difference based on materiality assessments.

#### Materiality in the context of ESG

Using a “risk matrix” approach, organizations can

- a large-cap e-commerce company may choose to focus on packaging materials and waste (environmental), supply chain labor standards (social) and business ethics (governance) in its materiality assessment 

#### Assessing double materiality. 

consider materiality from 2 viewpoints: 

- financial materiality 
- materiality to the market, the environment and people. 

organization is responsible for
- inward impact by managing its own financial risks
- outward impacts of its decisions and operations on people and the environment. 

organizations can identify both 
- the financial
- and nonfinancial impacts 


#### Impact and influence
The other side of the materiality coin is impact and influence. Organizations assessing their ESG reporting approach may also find it beneficial to consider the environmental and social factors that they can influence most directly and rapidly.
Using an action priority or impact effort prioritization matrix, organizations can quickly identify where to focus their initial efforts and then use these insights to determine which ESG framework can help with realizing goals that are within reach.
For example, organizations in the fast-moving consumer goods and retail sectors can exert influence within their supply chain. In these sectors, an organization’s procurement choices can have significant impact on the ESG

### 3.2 Lens 2: Stakeholder expectations

#### What are external stakeholders looking for?

- investors, boards, insurers and creditors 
  - Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or 
  - Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 
- Employees and consumers
  - United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)
- governments or regulators may prefer 
  - Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)
  - National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER)


#### How will internal stakeholders use the information?

- risk, compliance and HR teams 
  - would be invested in the data to drive strategic decisions around equity and inclusion
- energy and utilities would be looking closely at 
  - consumption and expenditure across the organization. 
- Procurement teams
  - to assess their supply chain operations and the risk profile ofsuppliers.

### 3.3 Lens 3: Geography

Certain ESG reporting frameworks are only relevant in particular geographies. (mandated by law, specific to local conditions).
- ENERGY STAR® (North America and select other countries)
- SECR (UK) and NGER (Australia)

### 3.4 Lens 4: Sector preference

- Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). 
  - real estate
  - infrastructure portfolios.

### 3.5 Lens 5: Framework coverage

Each ESG reporting frameworks has different levels of focus on the key ESG performance metrics, 
  including environment, social, governance, carbon, energy, waste and water.


## 4. Benchmark frameworks

### 4.1 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)

- To provide environmental information
  - environmental governance and policy
  - risks and opportunity management
  - environmental targets and strategy
  - scenario analysis
- Stakeholders investors, employees and customers

- 2 questionnaires on the topics of climate change, water and forests


### 4.2 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)

- to assess the sustainability performance of 
  - real estate and
  - infrastructure portfolios and assets

GRESB Assessments provide investors and asset managers with 

- provides material insights into
the sustainability performance of a company’s real assets. 

- These performance insights are aligned with 
    - GRI
    - Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). 
    
- Assessment participants receive 
  - comparative business intelligence on where they stand against their peers, 
  - a roadmap with actions they cantake to improve their ESG performance 
  - and a communication platform to engage with investors. 
  
- Investors use the ESG data and GRESB analytical tools to improve the sustainability performance of their investment portfolios, engage with managers and prepare for increasingly rigorous ESG obligations.

## 5. Voluntary frameworks

- allow reporters to select the questions they want to report against, 
  - depending on factors such as their industry of operation and their materiality. 
- Scoring is typically not included in these frameworks.

### 5.1 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

- provides standards detailing approaches to `materiality, management reporting and disclosure` for a comprehensive
range of sustainability issues. 
- GRI Standards guide many organizations in the production of their `own` sustainability reports.

#### How GRI works

- The modular, interrelated GRI Standards are designed primarily to be used as a set to prepare a sustainability report focused on material topics. 
- The 3 universal standards are used by every organization that reports under the GRI framework. 
- An organization also chooses from the topic-specific standards to report on its material `topics—economic`, `environmental` or `social`.

### 5.2 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

- to address `climate risks` to the business, falling within the “E” of ESG reporting. 
- helps to articulate how ESG performance is most likely to materially 
- impact future financial performance and value creation.

Broken into four pillars, the TCFD addresses disclosure requirements related to:
1. Governance: How does the organization’s governance structure address climate- related risks and opportunities?
2. Strategy: What are the tangible material impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the whole business, including strategy and financial planning?
3. Risk management: How does the organization define, assess and manage climate- related risks?
4. Metrics and targets: What are the measurements used to assess material climate- related risks and opportunities?

### 5.3 Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)  (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and  International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) )

- In June 2021, SASB and IIRC announced their `merger` to form the VRF
- ESG guidance framework that sets standards for the disclosure of `financially material sustainability` information 
- The resources they provide include the 
  - Integrated Thinking Principles, 
  - Integrated Reporting Framework 
  - SASB Standards.

- `SASB` Standards track ESG issues and performance across `77` industry standards. 
- `VRF’s` framework is built to support companies in sharing their `outward ESG impacts` through the language of investors,debt holders and internal financial stakeholders.

### How the SASB Standards work
- `GRI is most like SASB` but supplies more broadly material information for reporting to stakeholders who are `not just from financial portfolios`.

- Asset management companies such as `BlackRock`, `Goldman Sachs` and `Morgan Stanley`;
- manufacturing giants such as `GM` and `Nike`;
- Specialized industries with companies such as `Merck` and `JetBlue` use SASB Standards to disclose ESG metrics.

- SASB also supplies resources to `explain how investors` across multiple asset classes `use the standards`. 

## 6. Regulatory frameworks

- all responses are required
- not always scored
- required by a government body

### 6.1 Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

- for financial products and entities within the EU. 

- It does this by mandating Principal Adverse Impact (`PAI`) statement 
- SFDR will act in concert with the
  - `EU taxonomy` and the proposed 
  - `EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)`
  
-  financial bodies to report 
  - `weighted averages across` various ESG metrics for `their investments` as well as emissions from their `own activities`. 

- must report the proportion of their `investees` activities that they finance. 
- For example, if an `investee generates 100 metric tons` of hazardous waste and the `financial body has 20% of the equity` in that company, the financial body reports `20 metric tons` of hazardous waste in its SFDR PAI.

### 6.2 National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER)

- Australian national framework
- about GHG emissions, energy production and energy consumption.

- The NGER Scheme collects emissions-related data about GHGs such as 
  - carbon dioxide (CO2), 
  - methane (CH4), 
  - nitrous oxide (N2O), 
  - sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) 
  - specified kinds of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons. 

-  to verify the reported data during an external audit for
  - relevance
  - completeness
  - consistency
   - transparency
   - accuracy


### 6.3. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)

- UK government’s guidance 

- disclose energy use, GHG emissions and related information. 

- estimated 11,900 companies incorporated in the UK will need to report on their energy and carbon emissions under the new framework.
2
- required to disclose their 
    - `energy use`
    - global `Scope 1 and 2` GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent 
    -  at least `one emissions intensity metric` of their choosing for current and previous financial years.
- Scope 3 emissions remain voluntary but are recommended for emissions sources considered material.

- need to report
  - energy use 
  - associated GHG emissions from electricity, gas and transport fuels
  - well at least one intensity metric. 

## 7. Rating agencies

- require responses to all questions in the framework
- typically have a scoring element.

### 7.1 ENERGY STAR®

- `North America` that covers commercial buildings.
-  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) voluntary program 
- helps `save money` and `protect the climate` through superior energy efficiency
- `Rankings` :  compare the `performance of a building` against other `similar buildings`, called a `peer group`. 
- `Building owners`  : can benchmark their performance `internally` across their portfolio and `externally` among similar sectors.

- ENERGY STAR® `scores` are based on data from `national building energy consumption surveys`, 
- ENERGY STAR® `Portfolio Manager tool` to control for key variables affecting a building’s `energy performance`, including 
  - climate
  - hours of operation 
  - building size. 

- buildings from around the country
- with different operating parameters 
- subject to different weather patterns—can be compared side by side.
- The specific factors that are included in this normalization 
  - hours
  - workers
  - climate and more
  
- The 1–100 scale is set 
- 1 represents the worst-performing buildings 
- 100 represents the best-performing buildings
- 50 representing the average

### 7.2 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) questionnaire

- DJSI `tracks` the performance of the companies in terms of `economic, environmental and social criteria`
- used by investors who wish to jointly assess `financial` and `ESG aspects` of company performance.

- The DJSI applies a transparent, rules-based component `selection process` based on the company’s `Total Sustainability Scores` resulting from the annual `CSA`.

- The `CSA compare` companies across `61 industries` with questionnaires assessing a mix of `80–100` cross-
industry and industry-specific questions. 

- Companies `receive scores` ranging from `0 to 100 and percentile rankings` for approximately `20 financially` relevant sustainability `criteria` across economic, environmental and social dimensions. 

- `Only the top-ranked` companies within each industry are selected for inclusion in the DJSI family. 

- `Investors` in these indices `gain exposure` to the performance potential of well-known common factors
  - low volatility
  - dividend yield
  - value or momentum—while avoiding ESG-related risks in their portfolios 
by directing their investment toward more sustainable companies.

### 7.3 National Built Environment Ratings Scheme (NABERS) AU

- Using a `six-star` scale, NABERS helps `Australian building owners` understand how their `asset impacts the environment` and helps prospective tenants understand `how energy- efficient their leased space` is.

- NABERS `compares` the performance of a building or tenancy to benchmarks that represent the performance of `other similar buildings` in the same location. 
- NABERS `scores are calculated` by an independent assessor `using 12 months of real, measurable information` about a building or tenancy, such as 
  - energy 
  - water bills 
  - waste consumption data as the basis of their rating. 
- NABERS `ratings` are available for
  - commercial office buildings
  - tenancies, 
  - hotels, 
  - shopping centers
  - data centers.
- NABERS announced in 2019 a plan to `expand` to `all major building types`. 
Under Australia’s Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, all `buildings for sale` or under lease
over `10,000 sq ft` must `receive a NABERS rating`. 
- Governments are required to lease space in buildings with ``ratings of 4.5 or higher.

## 8. Preparing for growing ESG trends

### 8.1 AI-driven data scraping by ESG ratings tools

- `AI and bots` are used to evaluate an organization’s ESG performance through publicly available data. 
- This practice, known as `data scraping`, presents a `new challenge for organizations` because it means that the data being used to assess access to capital is largely `outside their control`.
- Various firms `synthesize ESG data` from different sources as below `to build an organization’s profile `
  - ranked and “best of” lists, 
  - product review websites, 
  - social media posts and comments, 
  - company databases
  - news articles .

- These scoring systems and the piecemeal data gathered through `data scraping don’t provide` the 
  - context, 
  - methodology used
  - granular detail required from most investors, 

#### How to prepare for an AI-driven ESG valuation
- With the practice of data scraping on an upward trend, investment and sustainability teams should consider the `following approach to regain control` of their data and protect the organization’s ESG valuation from the inevitable downsides AI-driven ESG data scraping.
- **Step 1**: Identify which rating agencies you need to target. `Approach` your key institutional `investors and ask` them `which ratings agencies they use`.
- **Step 2**: Understand `what data the target rating agencies use` and how they go about uncovering it. Ask the rating agencies directly if possible, or research online to uncover what you can.
- **Step 3**: Ensure that the data you’re providing and the places where you’re sharing it meet the needs of the rating agencies. To accomplish this, follow these tips:
- **Determine the best keywords**
- Check your organization’s `publicly available information` to ensure that the data captured by the AI data scraping and bots is accurate. 
- Undertake an `analysis of the terminology used` and adjust for clarity. 
- This analysis should be `applied` to your `organization’s website`, `comparison websites` and `company search databases such as Bloomberg`.
- **Employ social listening**
- Track `conversations online` to determine what has been published about your organization and attempt to rectify any inaccurate statements. 
- Examples include `customer reviews`, `Google business listings`, and `customer social media comments` and mentions of the organization.
- **Increase publicly available ESG information** 
- `Provide more data` in sustainability action plans and reports. 
- `Publish supporting documents` that go into further detail about the organization’s ESG performance and efforts. 
- This `data can then be published` on your organization’s `website, social media or other platforms`.

### 8.2 A global standard in ESG reporting

The future of ESG reporting can be seen from at least three perspectives: 
- `regulatory changes`, 
- `industry coalescence` around frameworks 
- `inter-framework` consolidation.

All these perspectives indicate one major directional move: the harmonization of ESG reporting frameworks.

- **Regulatory changes:** Various progress has been made across national and supranational jurisdictions. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission `(SEC) ` announced a proposal in March 2022 to mandate ESG disclosure modeled `off the TCFD`.

Similarly, the EU’s sustainable finance package—the `EU Taxonomy` and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which includes CSRD—will further require ESG-related disclosures from companies.

- **Industry sectors coalescing:** As the practice of ESG reporting matures, `industry sectors are coalescing around their preferred frameworks`. The early movers in this regard were in the `property sector`, which favors reporting against the `GRESB framework`. This trend occurs more recently among the investment community, with asset managers such as BlackRock encouraging their investees to report against SASB.

- **Framework consolidation:** These changes are resulting in a reporting landscape in which frameworks are becoming more specialized, as seen with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation and GRI, or are consolidating, as seen with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and SASB.

#### How to prepare for ESG reporting changes
With progressive steps toward a common language around ESG reporting and `new announcements` being made `every few months`, how can organizations better prepare for the inevitable changes facing ESG frameworks?
#### Get the data right
Having an `accurate and auditable data foundation today` means `avoiding historical errors and changing processes` when ESG reporting changes come into effect. Your ESG reporting software solution should help achieve this with an auditable data record and accurate emissions calculations.

The `solution should be regularly updated` in line with new framework requirements to ensure ESG reporting remains current with market obligations.
#### Build ties with the right stakeholders
Sustainability leaders should look beyond their current stakeholder group and consider others who can provide the granular data required from different frameworks and regulatory changes.
