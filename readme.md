# ESG Reporting frameworks and Envizi

ESG frameworks are used by organizations for the purpose of publicly reporting detailed environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics of the business

## Introduction


## ESG Frameworks

#### Global Agreements
A legally-binding commitment  between entities to achieve a specific set of outcomes of global importance, typically facilitated through diplomacy

### Framework Coverage

Each of the major ESG reporting frameworks has different levels of focus on the key ESG performance metrics. Understanding which framework focuses on which indicator can help with framework selection and provide insights into where organizations may be able to report to multiple frameworks using existing data. This matrix illustrates the focus areas for each reporting framework.

## 3. Selecting ESG reporting frameworks

### 3.1 Lens 1: Potential for impact

#### Materiality in the context of ESG

#### Assessing double materiality. 


#### Impact and influence

### 3.2 Lens 2: Stakeholder expectations
#### What are external stakeholders looking for?

#### How will internal stakeholders use the information?

### 3.3 Lens 3: Geography
### 3.4 Lens 4: Sector preference
### 3.5 Lens 5: Framework coverage

 ## Frameworks in Detail

Here is an overview of sustainability performance indicators used in each ESG framework. 

The major ESG reporting frameworks  are grouped into four categories:

- Benchmark frameworks
	- CDP, GRESB ESG frameworks
- Voluntary frameworks
	- GRI, TCFD, VRF (SASB + IIRC)
- Regulatory frameworks
	- SFDR, NGER, SECR
- Rating agencies
	- ENERGY STAR, DJSI (CSA), NABERS


### 4. Benchmark frameworks

These require responses to all questions in the framework and typically have a scoring element.

### 4.1 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)

CDP frameworks helps the companies to provide the stakeholders with the below environmental information.
- environmental governance and policy
- risks and opportunity management
- environmental targets and strategy
- scenario analysis

The stakeholders are investors, employees and customers.

CDP offers three questionnaires on the topics of climate change, water and forests.

### 4.2 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)

GRESB helps to assess the sustainability performance of real estate and infrastructure portfolios and assets.

The stakeholders are investors and asset managers.

GRESB provides material insights into the sustainability performance of a company’s real assets. 

These insights are aligned with international reporting frameworks such as the GRI and Principles for Responsible
Investment (PRI). 

Assessment participants receive the 
  - Comparative business intelligence on where they stand against their peers, 
  - A roadmap with actions they can take to improve their ESG performance 
  - A communication platform to engage with investors 
  
Investors use these to improve the sustainability performance of their investment portfolios.

## 5. Voluntary frameworks

These allow reporters to select the questions they want to report against, depending on factors such as their industry of operation and their materiality. Scoring is typically not included in these frameworks.

### 5.1 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 



GRI is a globally applicable guidance
framework that provides standards detailing
approaches to materiality, management
reporting and disclosure for a comprehensive
range of sustainability issues. GRI Standards
guide many organizations in the production of
their own sustainability reports.
How GRI works
The modular, interrelated GRI Standards
are designed primarily to be used as a set to
prepare a sustainability report focused on
material topics. The three universal standards
are used by every organization that reports
under the GRI framework. An organization
also chooses from the topic-specifc standards
to report on its material topics — economic,
environmental or social.



### 5.2 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
### 5.3 Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)  (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and  International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) )



- allow reporters to select the questions they want to report against, 
  - depending on factors such as their industry of operation and their materiality. 
- Scoring is typically not included in these frameworks.

### 5.1 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 

- provides standards detailing approaches to `materiality, management reporting and disclosure` for a comprehensive
range of sustainability issues. 
- GRI Standards guide many organizations in the production of their `own` sustainability reports.

#### How GRI works

- The modular, interrelated GRI Standards are designed primarily to be used as a set to prepare a sustainability report focused on material topics. 
- The 3 universal standards are used by every organization that reports under the GRI framework. 
- An organization also chooses from the topic-specific standards to report on its material `topics—economic`, `environmental` or `social`.

### 5.2 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

- to address `climate risks` to the business, falling within the “E” of ESG reporting. 
- helps to articulate how ESG performance is most likely to materially 
- impact future financial performance and value creation.

Broken into four pillars, the TCFD addresses disclosure requirements related to:
1. Governance: How does the organization’s governance structure address climate- related risks and opportunities?
2. Strategy: What are the tangible material impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the whole business, including strategy and financial planning?
3. Risk management: How does the organization define, assess and manage climate- related risks?
4. Metrics and targets: What are the measurements used to assess material climate- related risks and opportunities?

### 5.3 Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)  (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and  International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) )

- In June 2021, SASB and IIRC announced their `merger` to form the VRF
- ESG guidance framework that sets standards for the disclosure of `financially material sustainability` information 
- The resources they provide include the 
  - Integrated Thinking Principles, 
  - Integrated Reporting Framework 
  - SASB Standards.

- `SASB` Standards track ESG issues and performance across `77` industry standards. 
- `VRF’s` framework is built to support companies in sharing their `outward ESG impacts` through the language of investors,debt holders and internal financial stakeholders.

### How the SASB Standards work
- `GRI is most like SASB` but supplies more broadly material information for reporting to stakeholders who are `not just from financial portfolios`.

- Asset management companies such as `BlackRock`, `Goldman Sachs` and `Morgan Stanley`;
- manufacturing giants such as `GM` and `Nike`;
- Specialized industries with companies such as `Merck` and `JetBlue` use SASB Standards to disclose ESG metrics.

- SASB also supplies resources to `explain how investors` across multiple asset classes `use the standards`. 


## 6. Regulatory frameworks
Like benchmark frameworks in that all responses are required but not always scored. These frameworks and reporting requirements are also required by a government body

### 6.1 Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)
### 6.2 National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER)
### 6.3. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)

## 7. Rating agencies

These type of frameworks have a scoring element and are often responded to through a questionnaire that is not public.

### 7.1 ENERGY STAR®
### 7.2 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) questionnaire
### 7.3 National Built Environment Ratings Scheme (NABERS) AU

## 8. Preparing for growing ESG trends
### 8.1 AI-driven data scraping by ESG ratings tools
### 8.2 A global standard in ESG reporting
