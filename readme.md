# ESG Reporting frameworks and Envizi

ESG frameworks are used by organizations for the purpose of publicly reporting detailed environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics of the business

## Introduction

### Framework Coverage

Each of the major ESG reporting frameworks has different levels of focus on the key ESG performance metrics. Understanding which framework focuses on which indicator can help with framework selection and provide insights into where organizations may be able to report to multiple frameworks using existing data. This matrix illustrates the focus areas for each reporting framework.

## 3. Selecting ESG reporting frameworks

Large number and variety of ESG reporting frameworks are available. Applying different lenses to assess and categorize the various frameworks can help selecting the appropriate ESG reporting frameworks for your organization.

### 3.1 Lens 1: Potential for impact

The decision on which framework to report to use should start by considering where an
organization can make the most difference based on materiality assessments.

#### Materiality in the context of ESG

Using a “risk matrix” approach, organizations can

- a large-cap e-commerce company may choose to focus on packaging materials and waste (environmental), supply chain labor standards (social) and business ethics (governance) in its materiality assessment 

#### Assessing double materiality. 

consider materiality from 2 viewpoints: 

- financial materiality 
- materiality to the market, the environment and people. 

organization is responsible for
- inward impact by managing its own financial risks
- outward impacts of its decisions and operations on people and the environment. 

organizations can identify both 
- the financial
- and nonfinancial impacts 


#### Impact and influence
The other side of the materiality coin is impact and influence. Organizations assessing their ESG reporting approach may also find it beneficial to consider the environmental and social factors that they can influence most directly and rapidly.
Using an action priority or impact effort prioritization matrix, organizations can quickly identify where to focus their initial efforts and then use these insights to determine which ESG framework can help with realizing goals that are within reach.
For example, organizations in the fast-moving consumer goods and retail sectors can exert influence within their supply chain. In these sectors, an organization’s procurement choices can have significant impact on the ESG

### 3.2 Lens 2: Stakeholder expectations

#### What are external stakeholders looking for?

- investors, boards, insurers and creditors 
  - Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or 
  - Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). 
- Employees and consumers
  - United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)
- governments or regulators may prefer 
  - Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)
  - National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER)


#### How will internal stakeholders use the information?

- risk, compliance and HR teams 
  - would be invested in the data to drive strategic decisions around equity and inclusion
- energy and utilities would be looking closely at 
  - consumption and expenditure across the organization. 
- Procurement teams
  - to assess their supply chain operations and the risk profile ofsuppliers.

### 3.3 Lens 3: Geography

Certain ESG reporting frameworks are only relevant in particular geographies. (mandated by law, specific to local conditions).
- ENERGY STAR® (North America and select other countries)
- SECR (UK) and NGER (Australia)

### 3.4 Lens 4: Sector preference

- Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). 
  - real estate
  - infrastructure portfolios.

### 3.5 Lens 5: Framework coverage

Each ESG reporting frameworks has different levels of focus on the key ESG performance metrics, 
  including environment, social, governance, carbon, energy, waste and water.

 ## Frameworks in Detail

Here is an overview of sustainability performance indicators used in each ESG framework. 

The major ESG reporting frameworks  are grouped into four categories:

- Benchmark frameworks
	- CDP, GRESB ESG frameworks
- Voluntary frameworks
	- GRI, TCFD, VRF (SASB + IIRC)
- Regulatory frameworks
	- SFDR, NGER, SECR
- Rating agencies
	- ENERGY STAR, DJSI (CSA), NABERS


### 4. Benchmark frameworks

These require responses to all questions in the framework and typically have a scoring element.

### 4.1 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)

CDP frameworks helps the companies to provide the stakeholders with the below `environmental information`.
- environmental governance and policy
- risks and opportunity management
- environmental targets and strategy
- scenario analysis

The stakeholders are investors, employees and customers.

CDP offers three questionnaires on the topics of `climate change, water and forests`.

### 4.2 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)

GRESB helps to assess the sustainability performance of `real estate` and `infrastructure portfolios and assets`.

The stakeholders are investors and asset managers.

GRESB provides `material insights` into the sustainability performance of a company’s real assets. 

These insights are aligned with international reporting frameworks such as the `GRI` and Principles for Responsible
Investment `(PRI)`. 

Assessment participants receive the 
  - Comparative business intelligence on where they stand against their peers
  - A roadmap with actions they can take to improve their ESG performance 
  - A communication platform to engage with investors 
  
Investors use these to improve the sustainability performance of their investment portfolios.

## 5. Voluntary frameworks

These allow reporters to select the questions they want to report against, depending on factors such as their industry of operation and their materiality. Scoring is typically not included in these frameworks.

### 5.1 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
GRI is a globally applicable and most widely used reporting standard. It is designed to prepare a sustainability report focused on `material` topics. It is available in three sets:

#### Universal Standards: 
The Universal Standards applies to all organizations. It contains the three standards.
- GRI 1, Foundation
- GRI 2, General Disclosures
- GRI 3, Material Topics

#### Sector Standards: 
Specific standards are available across 40 sectors. Here are the 4 groups available for sectors.
- Group 1: Basic Materials and Needs
- Group 2: Industrial
- Group 3: Transport, Infrastructure, and Tourism
- Group 4: Other Services and Light Manufacturing

#### Topic Standards
Specific standards across 33 topics. They belongs to `Environmental, Social, Governance` and  other topics.

### 5.2 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

TCFD is explicitly designed to address `climate-related` financial risks of the business to investors, lenders and insurers, falling within the ‘E’ of ESG reporting. 

TCFD is made of 11 disclosures and divided into 4 pillars.

- **Governance** : Te organization’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities?
- **Strategy**: The actual and potential impacts of the climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy and financial planning.
- **Risk Management:** The process used by the organization to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks.
- **Metrics & Targets:** The metrics and targets used to assess and manage relvant limate-related risks and opportunities

### 5.3 Value Reporting Foundation (VRF)  (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and  International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) )

VRF is an ESG guidance framework that sets standards for the disclosure of `financially material sustainability` information.

In June 2021, SASB and IIRC are merged to form the VRF. 

VRF provides the following resources
  - Integrated Thinking Principles
  - Integrated Reporting Framework 
  - SASB Standards.

- `VRF’s` framework is built to support companies in sharing their `outward ESG impacts`
- `SASB` Standards track ESG issues and performance across `77` industry standards. 

## 6. Regulatory frameworks

Like benchmark frameworks in that all responses are required but not always scored. These frameworks and reporting requirements are also required by a government body.

### 6.1 Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

SFDR aims reporting of ESG metrics for `financial products and entities` within the `EU`. It does this by mandating Principal Adverse Impact `(PAI)` statement.

SFDR will act in concert with the `EU taxonomy` and the proposed `EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)`

SFDR’s PAI statement requires fnancial bodies to report different types of quantitative indicators, including `weighted averages across` various ESG metrics for `their investments` as well as emissions from their own activities.

This means that organizations must report the proportion of their investees’ activities that they fnance.

### 6.2 National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER)

NGER Scheme is the `Australian national framework` for reporting and disseminating company information about `GHG emissions, energy production and energy consumption`.

The NGER Scheme collects emissions-related data about GHGs such as 
- carbon dioxide (CO2)
- methane (CH4)
- nitrous oxide (N2O) 
- sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) 
- specified kinds of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons

NGER Act insists on records of activities must be adequate to verify during an external audit for relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy

### 6.3. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)

SECR taxonomy is the `UK government’s` guidance for organizations required to disclose `energy use, GHG emissions` and related information. 

It is expected that an 11,900 companies incorporated in the UK will need to report on their energy and carbon emissions under the new framework.

`Quoted` companies are required to disclose their 
- `Energy use`
- Global `Scope 1 and 2` GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent 
- At least `one emissions intensity` metric of their choosing for current and previous financial years.
- `Scope 3 emissions` remain voluntary.

`Unquoted` large companies and LLPs will also need to report
- their UK energy use 
- associated GHG emissions from electricity, gas and transport fuels
- as well at least one intensity metric. 


## 7. Rating agencies

These type of frameworks have a scoring element and are often responded to through a questionnaire that is not public.

### 7.1 ENERGY STAR®

ENERGY STAR is `energy rating` and benchmarking mechanism in `North America` that covers `commercial buildings`.

Rankings `compare the performance` of a building against other similar buildings, called a peer group.
Building owners can benchmark their performance across their portfolio.

ENERGY STAR scores are based on data from national building energy consumption surveys, which allows the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager tool to control for key variables affecting a building’s energy performance, including `climate, hours of operation and building size`.

### 7.2 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) questionnaire

DJSI `tracks` the performance of the companies by `economic, environmental and social criteria`

This is used by investors who wish to jointly assess `financial` and `ESG aspects` of company performance.

The DJSI applies a transparent, rules-based component `selection process` based on the company’s `Total Sustainability Scores` resulting from the annual `CSA`.

The `CSA compare` companies across `61 industries` with questionnaires assessing a mix of `80–100` cross-
industry and industry-specific questions. 

Companies `receive scores` ranging from `0 to 100 and percentile rankings`. 

`Only the top-ranked` companies within each industry are selected for inclusion in the DJSI family. 

### 7.3 National Built Environment Ratings Scheme (NABERS) AU

Using a `six-star` scale, NABERS helps `Australian building owners` understand how their `asset impacts the environment` and helps prospective tenants understand `how energy- efficient their leased space` is.

- NABERS `compares` the performance of a building or tenancy to benchmarks that represent the performance of `other similar buildings` in the same location. 
- NABERS `scores are calculated` by an independent assessor `using 12 months of real, measurable information` about a building or tenancy, such as 
  - energy 
  - water bills 
  - waste consumption data as the basis of their rating. 
- NABERS `ratings` are available for
  - commercial office buildings
  - tenancies, 
  - hotels, 
  - shopping centers
  - data centers.
- NABERS announced in 2019 a plan to `expand` to `all major building types`. 
Under Australia’s Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Act, all `buildings for sale` or under lease
over `10,000 sq ft` must `receive a NABERS rating`. 
- Governments are required to lease space in buildings with ``ratings of 4.5 or higher.
